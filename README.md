# HIVE

HIVE (Highly interconnected vernacular expression) is an anonymous messaging service.

To run it, simply create a virtual environment (recommended) and start it with `python3.6 run.py`.

It's built with the following technologies:

* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* SocketIO
* Ionic
* Capacitor

Protip: Update to *Node 10* for a compilation time that is less than ideal but still better than the suicide inducing Node 8.
